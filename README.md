## Introduction

This is the code for the two FIRST Tech Challenge teams from OHS (Team A & Team 1). There are two main directories in the code, "NXC" and "RobotC", corresponding to the programming language used in each. The "NXC" directory contains files used with the Bricx Command Center (BricxCC), which is used primarily for preliminary testing. The "RobotC" directory contains the final code that will be compiled and downloaded onto the robot. This directory is further subdivided into two more directories: "Team A" and "Team 1", which contain the code for their respective robots.
