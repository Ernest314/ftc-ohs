Remove unincluded header files (e.g., "<iostream>").
Replace "int main()" with "task main()".
Remove braces and "if(NXT::Open(&comm))" line.
Remove "else" line at end.
Remove "" line.
Remove "return 0;".
Remove all "extern" declarations.
Remove braces without code inbetween.
Add code/comment ("//code") between "#ifndef" and "#endif" where prompted.


If all else fails, resave header as type "*.nxc", but with a "*.h" extension.
